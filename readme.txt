A trustworthy message storage plugin for Contact Form 7.

== Description ==

Flamingo is a message storage plugin originally created for [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/), which doesn't store submitted messages.

After activation of the plugin, you'll find *Flamingo* on the WordPress admin screen menu. All messages through contact forms are listed there and are searchable. With Flamingo, you no longer need to worry about losing important messages due to mail server issues or misconfiguration in mail setup.
